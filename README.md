# Deep-Learning-based-Goods-Management

Goods management in supermarkets is a simple
yet time and effort consuming task. To mitigate the problem,
we propose a computer vision based goods management
system for supermarkets using Tiny YOLOv3 model,
Convolutional Neural Network and Keras. The system, with
a moving camera, can detect supermarket products such as
cans, bottles, bags, etc. as well as their corresponding prices
and barcodes thus allowing inventory management, empty
shelves and mispricing detection, etc. The system was trained
on our own dataset (object detection, 16 classes, using
transfer training) and the SVHN dataset (digit recognition).
Experiment results show that the system works well with
92.81% mAP (mean Average Precision) for object detection
and 92.28% of accuracy for digit recognition.
